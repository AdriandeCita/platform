Couple words, just to make it usable for now.

This is a cloned [Docc](https://gridsome.org/starters/docc/) template for [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/), with some customizations.

### How to

1. Clone this repository somewhere
2. Enter the project directory
3. Run `npm i` to install packages
4. Run `gridsome develop`, or `npx gridsome develop` to run dev server (assuming you may not have gridsome CLI installed globally). At this point it is ready to work with.
5. Run `gridsome build` (or `npx gridsome build` respectively) to generate static build, which may be then deployed.
